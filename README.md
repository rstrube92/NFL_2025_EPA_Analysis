# 🏈 NFL Strategy Deep Dive: Expected Points Added (EPA) Analysis (2025)

## Project Overview

This project uses advanced sports analytics metrics—specifically **Expected Points Added (EPA)**—to analyze the offensive strategies and in-game aggressiveness of all NFL teams from the 2025 season play-by-play data. The goal is to classify teams by offensive efficiency and assess the statistical success of 4th down decision-making.

## 🎯 Key Findings & Conclusions

### 1. The Passing Game Dominates Efficiency
Teams with the highest overall offensive EPA (e.g., GB, LA) are overwhelmingly driven by passing efficiency. The **Green Bay Packers (GB)**, the top-ranked offense by Total EPA ($119.874$), generate **16 times more EPA per pass ($0.278$) than per run ($0.017$)**.

### 2. Strategy Map Classification
The visualization highlights the different pathways to success:
* **Elite Offenses (Top Right):** Teams like **BUF** and **LA** are highly efficient in both passing and running.
* **Pass-Heavy Elite (Top-Middle/Right):** Teams like **GB** and **NE** (New England) succeed primarily by exceptional passing, despite inefficient running games (NE is at $-0.074$ Run EPA).
* **Run-First Efficiency:** **Indianapolis (IND)** stands out, achieving a very high $0.143$ Run EPA, making them one of the few top-performing offenses with a relatively balanced approach (though still Pass-advantaged).

### 3. Aggressiveness Success
The statistical success rate on 4th-down attempts is high for top teams. The **Chiefs (KC)** and **Patriots (NE)** were among the most successful when going for it on 4th down (Success Rates of $0.750$ and $0.778$ respectively), demonstrating the statistical benefit of maximizing value in high-leverage situations.

## Methodology and Results

### 1. Data Cleaning and Metric Calculation

The analysis filtered $35,900$ total plays down to $25,396$ relevant `Pass` and `Run` plays with non-missing EPA values. The following metrics were calculated for each team:

* **Pass/Run EPA:** Average Expected Points Added per pass/run play.
* **Total EPA:** Sum of EPA generated by the offense (our primary performance indicator).
* **Success Rate 4th Down:** Percentage of 4th down Pass/Run plays (yards to go $\le 10$) where the play resulted in EPA $> 0$.

### 2. NFL Strategy Map Visualization

This plot illustrates the offensive identity of all 32 teams, with **labels included for every team** to clearly identify the strategy each team employs.
